Home directory and ~: A home directory, also called a login directory, is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories and programs. It is also the directory that a user is first in after logging into the system. The tilde (~) is a Linux "shortcut" to denote a user's home directory. Thus tilde slash (~/) is the beginning of a path to a file or directory below the user's home directory.
 - This is used to go back to your pc home user (basically your desktop). Home directory (cd) and cd ~ bring you to the computerâ€™s home directory which is under user/username.
 - This is done by typing cd or cd ~


file paths in Linux: PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files (i.e., ready-to-run programs) in response to commands issued by a user.
